Conclusion
One of the main difficulties I found during this project, was understanding which semantic HTML was the best one to use for certain sections of the website, however with a lot of trial and error, it was able to work. Another difficulty I found was the nav bar being out of line with the H1 heading, however it was easily changed, oncce I figured out that it was due to a "nav" element being insdie of the ".header {" attribute.
